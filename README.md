. In some creative way, we were supposed to summarize the book, in some creative way.  What I did, was basiclly make a text based adventure game where you play as]
the protangonist, Ivan Deniscovovih, in what he experienced one day in a gulag, in where he was sentenced 10 years to.  This is written in Python.
